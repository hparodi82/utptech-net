### Exterior Cleaning That Keeps Your Business Looking Up To Par

Curb appeal isn’t just about looking nice — it’s part of your **brand, safety, and customer experience**.

With **Up To Par Technologies**, our power washing services are focused on **restaurants, clinics, offices, retail centers, and commercial sites** that need to look clean and professional every day, not just after a remodel.

We remove built-up grime, grease, gum, and stains from high-traffic areas so walkways, drive-thrus, patios, and entries stay welcoming, safe, and on-brand.

> We treat every property like it has your name on it — because it does.
> Clean lines, even finishes, and detailed edges that make your building look ready for business.

1. **Concrete, Sidewalk & Entryway Cleaning**  
2. **Grease, Oil & Dumpster Pad Degreasing**  
3. **Building, Awning & Drive-Thru Washes**

#### Power Washing Built Around Your Business Hours

We know you still have to **run your business** while we clean it.

That’s why we:

- Schedule **off-hours or early-morning service** to avoid disrupting customers  
- Use surface cleaners and proper chemicals to reduce streaking and damage  
- Focus on **safety around guests, staff, and vehicles** while working  
- Provide **before-and-after photos** so you can see and share the results  

Whether it’s a single storefront, a medical office, or multiple locations across Texas,
our goal is simple — keep your exterior **clean, safe, and truly up to par** every time your customers pull up.
