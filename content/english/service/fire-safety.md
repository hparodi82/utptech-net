### Fire Protection That Keeps Your Business Ready For Inspection

Through **Up To Par Technologies** and our partnership with **RGV Fire Extinguisher Company**, we provide
fire & life-safety services that keep your locations **code-compliant, properly tagged, and ready for surprise inspections**.

From restaurants and clinics to offices and warehouses, we make sure your extinguishers, emergency lighting,
and related safety equipment are installed, serviced, and documented the right way — not just “good enough.”

> We focus on doing the small things right: proper placement, correct sizing, clear labels, and clean documentation —
> so when the inspector walks in, you’re already up to par.

1. **Fire Extinguisher Sales, Service & Tagging**  
2. **Kitchen Hood & Suppression System Support**  
3. **Emergency Lighting, Exit Signs & Compliance Documentation**

#### Fire & Life-Safety You Don’t Have To Worry About

Fire protection shouldn’t only get attention when a tag is expired.

We help Texas businesses stay ahead of the curve by:

- Inspecting, recharging, and replacing **ABC, K-class, and specialty extinguishers**  
- Supporting **kitchen hood and suppression systems** alongside your extinguisher program  
- Testing and servicing **emergency lights and exit signs** so egress paths stay compliant  
- Providing **clear inspection reports and documentation** for owners, managers, and insurance

Instead of juggling multiple vendors, you get a team that understands both **field operations and compliance** —
keeping your people safer and your business ready for the next fire marshal visit.
