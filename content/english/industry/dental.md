### Infrastructure That Keeps Your Dental Practice Running Smooth

Dental teams live on **schedules, uptime, and trust**. If the network is slow, the phones are down, or the office looks rough from the outside, patients feel it right away.

At **Up To Par Technologies**, we support:

- **Single-chair offices & boutique practices**
- **Multi-location dental groups & DSOs**
- **Specialty practices** like endo, ortho, and oral surgery

with a combined focus on **technology, safety, and curb appeal** — so your patients experience a clean, professional, and well-run practice from door to operatory.

> We understand chair time is everything. Our goal is to protect it with reliable networks, clean spaces, and safety systems that just work.

1. **Managed IT & Structured Cabling for Dental Software & Imaging**  
2. **Fire Extinguisher & Life-Safety Support for Dental Facilities**  
3. **Exterior Power Washing & Entryway Cleaning for Patient Confidence**

#### Built Around Dental Workflows & Patient Experience

Dental environments have unique needs: digital imaging, PMS software, VoIP, and strict cleanliness and safety expectations.

We help dental practices and DSOs by:

- Designing and supporting **network and cabling** for practice management, imaging, phones, and guest Wi-Fi  
- Coordinating **fire extinguisher inspections and safety equipment** so you stay compliant with landlord, AHJ, and insurance requirements  
- Keeping **exteriors, sidewalks, and entry areas clean** so patients see a professional space before they even step inside  
- Providing **clear documentation** for owners, office managers, and regional leadership

With **UTP Tech**, you don’t have to juggle three vendors for IT, safety, and building presentation — you get one partner making sure every location is truly **up to par**.
