### Keep Your Property Guest-Ready, Inside and Out

In hospitality, **every detail affects the guest experience** — from Wi-Fi reliability and safety readiness  
to how your entrances, walkways, and patios look when guests arrive.

**Up To Par Technologies** helps:

- Hotels and boutique properties  
- Extended-stay and corporate lodging  
- Resorts, event centers, and conference spaces  

We blend **smart technology, life-safety services, and exterior power washing** so your property feels  
professional, safe, and welcoming at every touchpoint.

> When a guest checks in, they shouldn’t notice the tech, safety systems, or cleaning —  
> they should just feel everything is clean, safe, and working the way it should.

1. **Secure Wi-Fi, Network & Structured Cabling For Guest & Staff Areas**  
2. **Fire Extinguisher & Life-Safety Readiness For Rooms, Corridors & Back-of-House**  
3. **Power Washing For Entrances, Pool Decks, Walkways & Parking Areas**

#### A Partner Focused on Guest Experience & Brand Standards

Your brand reputation is built on consistency — every stay, every property.

UTP Tech supports hospitality locations by:

- Designing and maintaining **network and cabling** that support POS, cameras, back-office, and guest Wi-Fi  
- Keeping **fire extinguishers, emergency lighting, and egress paths** inspection-ready and compliant  
- Power washing **driveways, porte cochères, sidewalks, patios, loading zones, and dumpster pads**  
- Providing **before/after photos and clear reports** you can share with operations, ownership, and brand reps  

Whether you manage a single hotel or a growing portfolio,  
**Up To Par Technologies** helps keep your locations **connected, compliant, and guest-ready** —  
so every arrival feels like a good first impression.
