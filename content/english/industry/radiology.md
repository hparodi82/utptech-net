### Infrastructure That Keeps Imaging Rooms Online and On Time

Radiology and imaging environments depend on **uptime, clean power, and stable connectivity**.  
If PACS is slow, studies won’t load. If the network drops, modalities can’t send. If the site looks neglected, patients and referring providers notice.

**Up To Par Technologies** supports:

- **Outpatient imaging centers**
- **Hospital-based radiology departments**
- **Multi-site diagnostic groups and joint ventures**

with a combined focus on **network reliability, life safety, and professional presentation** — so your teams can focus on accurate reads, fast turnarounds, and patient care.

> When every study matters, the last thing you need is a dropped connection, a tripped breaker, or an unsafe environment.

1. **Network, Cabling & IT Support for PACS, RIS, and Modalities**  
2. **Fire Extinguisher & Life-Safety Services for Clinical Spaces**  
3. **Exterior Power Washing & Entryway Cleaning for Patient Confidence**

#### Built For High-Uptime Clinical Environments

Radiology has some of the **most demanding technical and safety requirements** in a facility.  
We help keep your environment aligned with those expectations by:

- Designing and supporting **structured cabling and network paths** for PACS, RIS, DICOM traffic, voice, and admin workflows  
- Coordinating **fire extinguisher placement, inspections, and tagging** in imaging suites, control rooms, and support spaces  
- Helping keep **sidewalks, patient drop-offs, and staff entries clean and safe** with targeted power washing and exterior maintenance  
- Providing **clear documentation and labeling** so on-call IT, clinical engineering, and leadership always know what’s in place

With **UTP Tech**, you get one partner who understands that your network closet, your safety equipment,  
and your front entrance all impact **patient throughput, staff efficiency, and trust** — keeping your imaging sites truly **up to par**.
